## About Disaster Connect

**Disaster Connect** is a crowdsourced emergency response website that allows individuals to report live incidents using geo-tagged photos or videos. 

Users can upload reports about disasters happening in their vicinity, and others can view these updates in real-time. Additionally, users can specify a notification radius (e.g., 50 km) to receive alerts only for incidents within their selected area, ensuring they stay informed without unnecessary global notifications.
